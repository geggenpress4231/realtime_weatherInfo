WorldWide Cleveland Weather Live
This project is a simple web application that displays live weather information for the city of Cleveland, Ohio and other nearby cities. The application uses the Google Maps API to display a map of the area, and the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve live weather data.

How to use
To use the application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The map will display the city of Toronto by default, but you can click on the markers to view weather information for other nearby cities, including Cleveland.
